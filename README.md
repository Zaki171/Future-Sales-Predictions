# Future-Sales-Predictions

In this project the task was to predict the number of items sold from a shop in November 2015 given data from 3 years before. I was required to join the datasets together, remove outliers, encode the categorical variables and group the data. Then I implemented my model, which is currently the RandomForestRegression model, to fit to the training data and predict the number of units sold in the test data.
